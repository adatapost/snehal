What is a "Program"?
  
  It is a set of "instructions" and "data".

Which system is responsible to execute the programs?

  Ans: An perating system

  The "Operating System" can execute the "programs" that contains "instructions & data" in Native language or machine language or binary language.


Type of programs
------------------
  We've two types of "programs":
   
  1. Source program and
  2. Object program

  Source Program/code - A "program/code" that is written by human using any programming 
			language syntax.

			For example, hello.c is a C language source program
				     Hello.java is a Java source code file
				     Hello.cs is a C# source code/program

  Object program/code - A "program/code" contains native or machine instructions & data.

		
 There are "translator" software that convert or translate source code/program into "object code/program" and these are :

    1. Compiler and
    2. Interpreter

 Compiler -- It reads whole source program, examine syntax rules of all instructions (entire              file), and generate "object code" if source code is error free. It lists the errors 	     (syntax errors) otherwise.

 Interpreter -- It reads one by line from source prgoram -- a line at a time, verify its syntax,
                translate this line into object code and pass the object code to OS to run that
		instruction if that line is error free. Halts program and displays error message
		otherwise.


How floating point value represented into the RAM/Memory?

  Computer system uses "Exponent-Mentisaa" sytem to represent floating point data.

For instance,
   2.5 <--- Human decimal system

is expressed as,
   25
  ---
   10
                                       power
  Now, Exponent symbol E means value 10     
                     10
    e.g e+10 means 10
                     -5
        e-5  means 10
               1          -1
  25E-1 = 25 x--- = 25 x 10    E stands for Exponent -- Scientific notation 
               10  

   100  = 1E+2
   1000 = 1E+3
   1..... = 1E+30
