Memory Architecture of program
------------------------------

How much bytes or memory will be assigned to a running program? This question address the usage of memory (RAM) by a program.

Ans:

  When we launch/start/run a program, the memory manager of "OS" allocate 1 MB RAM for each
  running program an this 1 MB RAM area is called "STACK Frame" area. 

  Now, if you (your program) need more meory than "STACK Frame" then you must have to
  request the memory manager of OS for more memory via malloc/calloc (C Language) functions or
  "new" keyword in C++, Java,C#, VB.NET, PHP (and many more) languages. This type of memory
  area is called "HEAP Frame".

Object?
----------
  
  The "allocated bytes" is known as an "Object".

  OR Partitioned area of RAM is calle an "object".

  The "size" of an object can be vary from 1 bytes to 2 GB or more (as required).

Example: Create three objects of int (4 bytes long) in .NET, 

          System.Int32 a,b,c;   
     
          Where System.Int32 is a datatype and this instruction tells memory manager to
	  reserved "4" bytes for each object. 

            Here, we've three objects,

|---------|
|---------|
|---------|
|---------|
|---------|
|---------|
|---------|
|---------| 1003 
|---------| 1002
|---------| 1001
|---------| 1000  = a   <--- byte number 1000 to 1003 (4 bytes) area is called an object
|---------| ..               and this object is accessed via "memory address/reference" or
                             variable name.

What is variable?

   A variable is an alias of an object.

 Or

  A variable is name (symbol) that represents the memory address of an object.

 Or

  It addresses an object location.
